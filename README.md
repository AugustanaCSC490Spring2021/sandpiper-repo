# sandpiper-repo

Team Sandpiper is proposing to make the Viking Ready app, which will be an all-in-one resource and support app for Augustana Students. Most importantly we want to allow students quick and easy access to the many resources that Augustana provides, a route alternative to the Augustana.edu homepage. On top of this we envision adding several features to boost utility of this app for Augustana students.
